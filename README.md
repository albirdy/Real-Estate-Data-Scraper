This is a Scraper that collects data from Remax website and creates/writes a CSV file real-Estate agents use to gather information such as address, price, MLS#, and number of bedrooms from each listing on the page reffered to in the URL variable. because it outputs a csv file, real-estate agents are able to manipulate the data in excel and run various queries against it. Because it it based off a URL it may also be repurposed for any remax listing page allowing users to easily collect Real-Estate data from multiple places.
